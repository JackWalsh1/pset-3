/**
 * Problem Set 3.
 * 
 * It's time to put your skills to the test. This problem set focuses on using
 * conditional control structures. It's also your first introduction to methods,
 * so things look a little different. The main method is done for you. Lines 31-40
 * trigger each of the predefined methods, which you can think of as self-contained
 * executable pieces of logic. Write your code for each exercise in the
 * corresponding method.
 * 
 * The specifications for each exercise are outlined below. Your job is to write
 * lines of code to produce answers to my questions. Each exercise requires that
 * you ask the user to enter one or more values. Your code must meet the
 * requirements set forth in this section (as well as the Deliverables section).
 * 
 * Work through these exercises on your own. Experiment, make mistakes, ask
 * questions, and fix your mistakes. It's the only way to get good at programming.
